## 🧭 Strategy & Vision

- Establish **documentation and process discipline** early (KBs, diagrams, code comments).  
- Advocate for **modernization and maintainability** through data-driven proposals.  
- Select technologies that balance **scalability, maintainability, and ease of onboarding**.  
- Use greenfield initiatives to demonstrate **IT’s strategic value** (not just operational cost).

## 🧠 Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Status |
|------|-----------|------------|--------|
| TBD | Select PHP framework or new stack | Evaluate Laravel, Slim, Spring Boot, Node/Nest | 🔄 |

---

## ✅ Next Actions

- [ ] Document existing architecture and dependencies  
- [ ] Outline rebuild evaluation criteria (tech stack, hosting, DB)  
- [ ] Create PHP learning roadmap  
- [ ] Begin logging technical debt and “WTF” moments
