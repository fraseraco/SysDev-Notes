## 🎯 Purpose
To deliver measurable efficiency gains, improve system visibility, and modernize Prime Metal’s internal tools through targeted automation and data-driven enhancements—while ensuring all improvements directly support production, cost control, and scalability.

---

## 🧭 Strategic Objectives
1. **Reduce repetitive manual work** via automation and scheduled reporting.  
2. **Increase operational visibility** through dashboards and analytics.  
3. **Improve decision speed** with accurate, real-time production data.  
4. **Enhance data integrity & security** using structured access control.

## ⚙️ Phase 1 (0–6 Months): Quick Wins
*Establish credibility, save time, and improve visibility.*

| Project | Focus | Outcome | Business Impact |
|----------|--------|----------|----------------|
| **Automated Reporting System** | SQL optimization & backend automation | Auto-generates daily/weekly production & sales reports | ⏱️ Saves ~15 hrs/week of manual reporting (~$12–15k/year labor) |
| **Digital Work Order Dashboard** | Full-stack UI & data visualization | Displays live status of active jobs by stage | 📊 Reduces coordination delays ~30%, improves on-time completion |
| **Maintenance Request Tracker** | Workflow automation | Logs & prioritizes machine repair tickets with timestamps | ⚙️ Reduces unplanned downtime by ~10% |

**Total Expected ROI (Phase 1):**  
→ ~$25–40k annual savings in efficiency & downtime reduction  
→ Foundational credibility for deeper modernization efforts

## 🚀 Phase 2 (6–12 Months): Strategic Builds
*Leverage data and automation to improve throughput and profitability.*

| Project | Focus | Outcome | Business Impact |
|----------|--------|----------|----------------|
| **Production Throughput Dashboard** | ETL + analytics (Grafana / SQL) | Visualizes bottlenecks, tracks shift-level efficiency | 📈 +5–10% throughput gain = major labor efficiency increase |
| **Internal Quoting Tool** | Business process automation | Auto-calculates quotes from part/labor data; generates PDFs | 💰 Cuts quote prep from hours → minutes; faster sales response |
| **Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC)** | Application security | Adds tiered permissions and audit logging | 🔐 Improves compliance and data integrity |

**Total Expected ROI (Phase 2):**  
→ ~$50–80k in annualized value from faster quoting, improved throughput, and reduced waste

## 📈 Measurable Outcomes
| Area | Baseline | Target (12 mo) | Expected Impact |
|-------|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| Reporting Labor | ~15 hrs/week | <3 hrs/week | ↓80% manual effort |
| Production Throughput | — | +5–10% | ↑ Efficiency, same headcount |
| Unplanned Downtime | — | ↓10–15% | ↑ Equipment availability |
| Quote Turnaround | 2–4 hrs | <20 min | ↑ Sales conversions |
| Manual Coordination Calls | — | ↓30% | ↑ Productivity & visibility |

## 💡 Implementation Philosophy
- **Business-first:** Every modernization justified by measurable savings or time reduction.  
- **Incremental delivery:** Build, measure, and refine each feature before scaling.  
- **Sustainable modernization:** Avoid tech churn; integrate modern tools (Docker, CI/CD, APIs) only where they add clear value.  

---

## 🧩 Next Steps
1. Confirm immediate Phase 1 priorities with leadership.  
2. Collect current performance metrics (reporting time, downtime, throughput).  
3. Begin automation and dashboard development cycles.  
4. Present quarterly progress updates with metrics.

---

**Summary:**  
These initiatives align with Prime Metal’s operational goals—cutting inefficiencies, improving production insight, and enabling scalable growth. The combined impact of these projects will strengthen reliability, reduce costs, and modernize our internal systems for the future.
