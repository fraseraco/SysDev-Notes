# 📈 Greenfield Projects & Strategic Visibility

## 🎯 Objective

Identify, design, and deliver new internal tools or process improvements that:
- increase efficiency 
- reduce manual effort 
- elevate IT’s visibility as a **strategic partner** rather than an operational cost.  

Projects should align with:
- business goals
- showcase technical competence
- produce measurable ROI or user impact.

---

## 📍 Scope
**Includes**
- Proposals for new internal applications or automation systems  
- Process improvement and data-driven initiatives  
- Integrations that streamline workflows across departments  
- Low-code or full-stack tools that demonstrate business value  
- Metrics and case studies for executive visibility

**Excludes**
- Refactoring or maintenance of legacy systems (see [[Refactor & Rebuild Planning]])  
- Routine IT support (see [[IT Operations & Support (Overview)]])

---

## 🧭 Strategy
- Target **pain points with broad visibility** (e.g., manual data entry, disjointed workflows).  
- Prioritize **projects that free up employee time** or **improve decision-making** through better data.  
- Communicate wins effectively — short demos, before/after metrics, and visible improvements.  
- Leverage these projects to make the department **budget-positive** in perception and influence.

## 💡 Project Ideation Framework
| Criterion | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **Impact** | How many people or departments benefit |
| **Visibility** | Likelihood executives or end users will notice the change |
| **Feasibility** | Development effort, technical complexity, dependencies |
| **Longevity** | Lifespan and maintainability |
| **Synergy** | Alignment with rebuild and long-term IT strategy |

Use these as scoring axes in `/docs/greenfield-project-matrix.xlsx`.

---

## 🧩 Candidate Projects (early brainstorm)
| Idea | Description | Impact | Feasibility | Notes |
|------|--------------|---------|--------------|-------|
| **Internal Request Portal** | Unified place for staff to submit IT, facilities, or HR requests; auto-routes tickets and logs metrics. | High | Med | Immediate visibility, reduces emails. |
| **Asset Tracking System** | Web app for managing equipment loans, licenses, and repairs. | High | Med | Good testbed for rebuild stack. |
| **Metrics Dashboard** | Aggregates key ops data (uptime, tickets closed, deployments). | High | Med | Shows IT performance visually to leadership. |
| **Document Versioning / KB Portal** | Self-service internal knowledge base tied to Git or DB. | Med | Med | Useful for onboarding, keeps documentation alive. |
| **Backup Integrity Monitor** | Validates backups, generates daily status emails. | Medium | Low | Security-minded, aligns with CTO priorities. |
| **Internal Chatbot** | Automates common support requests (“reset password,” “where is form X”). | Medium | High | Demonstrates innovation. |

## 🚀 Project Lifecycle (per-project template)
1. **Proposal (Idea → RFC)**  
   - Define problem, business case, scope, timeline, and measurable outcomes.  
2. **Design**  
   - Diagram architecture; reuse components from rebuild stack where possible.  
3. **Prototype**  
   - Timeboxed proof of concept (≤2 weeks).  
4. **Pilot**  
   - Limited release to one department; collect feedback & metrics.  
5. **Launch**  
   - Deploy broadly with documentation and announcement.  
6. **Post-Launch Review**  
   - Measure impact, gather testimonials, and present ROI metrics.

## 📊 Measuring Impact
| Metric | Description | Source | Reporting |
|---------|-------------|---------|------------|
| Time Saved | Average hours saved per week for staff | Surveys, logs | Monthly KPI |
| Ticket Volume Change | Reduction in repetitive requests | Ticket system | Monthly |
| Adoption Rate | Active users vs total staff | App logs | Quarterly |
| ROI Estimate | Cost saved or revenue gained | Calculated | Quarterly |
| Satisfaction | User feedback (1–5 scale) | Post-launch survey | After rollout |

Create a **Greenfield KPI Dashboard** (manual or automated) to track these.

---

## 🧩 Communication & Visibility Plan
- Maintain **running list of projects** and statuses in a shared dashboard or Confluence page.  
- Present **quarterly demos** to leadership (“IT Innovations Roundup”).  
- Create **brief one-page summaries** of each project (problem → solution → impact → metrics).  
- Partner with the CTO for visibility at all-hands or executive updates.

## 🧠 Documentation Templates

## Template: Project Proposal (RFC)
### RFC-GF-XXX: {Project Title}
**Owner:** {Name} 
**Status:** Idea | Proposal | Active | Completed  
**Summary:**  
Briefly describe the problem and the proposed solution.  
**Business Impact:**  
Who benefits and how (include quantitative or qualitative gains).  
**Technical Overview:**  
Stack, architecture sketch, integrations.  
**Timeline:**  
Milestones and rough effort estimate.  
**Metrics:**  
Time saved, adoption, satisfaction, ROI.  
**Risks:**  
Operational or security considerations.


## Template: Post-Launch Review
### Post-Launch Report – {Project}
**Launch Date:**  
**Adoption Metrics:**  
**ROI Summary:**  
**Lessons Learned:**  
**Next Iteration:**

## 📅 Example Timeline for Greenfield Work
| Quarter | Focus | Example Deliverables |
|----------|--------|----------------------|
| Q1 | Identify & prototype 1 high-impact internal tool | Prototype + RFC |
| Q2 | Pilot & launch first tool | Rollout + demo |
| Q3 | Integrate monitoring/metrics across systems | Shared dashboards |
| Q4 | Annual presentation to leadership | Impact report |

---

## 🧭 Success Criteria
- ≥2 projects per year deployed with measurable ROI.  
- Documented reduction in manual work or response times.  
- Regular demos increasing IT’s visibility with leadership.  
- Reuse of rebuild stack components (showing technical alignment).  
- Consistent internal “wins” improving IT reputation and influence.

---

## ✅ Next Actions
- [ ] Identify 3–5 candidate ideas with clear business pain points.  
- [ ] Score ideas using the greenfield matrix.  
- [ ] Draft 1–2 RFCs for highest-scoring candidates.  
- [ ] Create lightweight presentation template for demos.  
- [ ] Begin prototyping first MVP.
