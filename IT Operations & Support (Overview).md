# 🔧 IT Operations & Support

##  Objective
Handle day-to-day technical support tasks efficiently while using patterns, documentation, and automation to reduce recurring effort.  
Ensure consistent service quality, minimize interruptions, and improve IT visibility through process maturity and data-driven improvements.

---

##  Scope
**Includes**
- Level 1/2 troubleshooting for internal staff (hardware, software, access)
- Ticket handling, escalation, and communication workflows
- Documentation and knowledge base (KB) creation
- Identifying and automating repetitive support tasks
- Collaborating with IT Support on shared issues or escalations
- Tracking and reporting on IT performance metrics

**Excludes**
- Software rebuild or system refactors (see [[Refactor & Rebuild Planning]])
- Greenfield development (see [[Greenfield Projects & Strategic Visibility]])

---

## Strategy
1. **Triage smartly** — resolve what’s within scope, escalate quickly when needed.  
2. **Document once, reuse often** — turn every solved issue into a KB entry or script.  
3. **Automate repetitive tasks** — reduce manual fixes through scripting and self-service tools.  
4. **Collect data** — ticket counts, response times, and common problem areas.  
5. **Communicate clearly** — update requesters, notify stakeholders, close the loop.

---

##  Support Workflow

### 1. Intake
- Ticket created (email, portal, chat, etc.)
- Categorize (hardware, access, network, software, account)
- Assign priority (P1 critical → P4 minor)

### 2. Diagnose
- Gather context (user, device, location, last-known-good)
- Check KB for existing solutions
- Verify reproducibility

### 3. Resolve or Escalate
- **Resolve:** Fix and document steps  
- **Escalate:** Forward with full context (error logs, actions tried, screenshots)

### 4. Document & Close
- Log fix steps in ticket
- Add or update KB entry
- Confirm resolution with user
- Tag category for future metrics

## Ticket Categories
| Category        | Examples                        | Owner | Notes                               |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- | ----- | ----------------------------------- |
| Access Issues   | Password resets, MFA problems   |       | Common – automation target          |
| Hardware        | Monitors, peripherals, laptops  |       | Coordinate for replacements         |
| Network         | Wi-Fi, VLAN, cabling            |       | Capture before/after metrics        |
| Software        | Application errors, permissions |       | Tie fixes to codebase when relevant |
| Misc / Requests | "Can you install..." etc.       |       | Triage; route as needed             |

## Automation Opportunities
| Area                      | Current Pain     | Proposed Solution                            | Priority |
| ------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| (example) Password resets | Manual, repeated | Self-service portal or script                | High     |
| User provisioning         |                  | ~~Template-based script (AD or app DB)~~     |          |
| Device onboarding         |                  | ~~Preconfigured imaging or setup checklist~~ |          |
| Reporting                 |                  | ~~Scripted summary from ticket DB~~          |          |
| Common installs           |                  | ~~Batch installer or config mgmt~~           |          |

## Metrics & Reporting
| Metric | Description | Goal | Frequency |
|---------|-------------|------|------------|
| Tickets Resolved | Number closed per week | Baseline | Weekly |
| First Response Time | Avg time from open → response | <1 hr (work hours) | Weekly |
| Repeat Issues | Same problem reopened | ↓ over time | Monthly |
| KB Growth | New entries added | +2/week | Monthly |
| Automation Impact | Tasks automated | Measurable reduction | Quarterly |

> Create a basic Excel or Grafana dashboard later for visualization.

---

## Escalation Guidelines
| Severity | Description | Response | Escalation Target |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|--------------------|
| **P1** | System outage / multiple users down | Immediate | CTO / Senior IT Support |
| **P2** | Business-impacting but limited | Within 30m | IT Support |
| **P3** | Minor issue / workaround available | Same day | Self-resolve |
| **P4** | Cosmetic / low-priority | Within 2 days | Self-resolve |

---

## Example SOPs
- **Password Reset SOP** – Verify identity → Reset → Log → Notify  
- **Hardware Swap SOP** – Document serials → Replace → Verify config → Close ticket  
- **Network Drop SOP** – Ping test → Trace route → Verify VLAN → Escalate if persistent  
- **Software Install SOP** – Check licensing → Install → Test → Document version  

---

## Quick Scripts to Build
| Script | Purpose | Language | Priority |
|--------|----------|-----------|----------|
| `reset_user_pw.php` | Reset local app passwords | PHP CLI | High |
| `create_user_template.sh` | Standard user setup | Bash | Medium |
| `sys_healthcheck.ps1` | Basic Windows health check | PowerShell | Medium |
| `backup_verify.py` | Verify backup timestamps | Python | Low |

---

## 3-Month Operations Roadmap
| Month | Focus | Deliverables |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| **Month 1** | Documentation & ticket flow | KB skeleton + SOP templates |
| **Month 2** | Automation setup | Password reset script + user onboarding |
| **Month 3** | Metrics & optimization | Weekly reports + dashboard MVP |

---

## Success Criteria
- Reduced ticket turnaround time by measurable %  
- ≥1 new automation per quarter  
- 90%+ ticket closure satisfaction (internal survey)  
- Consistent KB updates (living documentation)  
- CTO visibility on IT metrics & improvements  

---

## Next Actions
- [ ] Build initial KB folder and populate 3 entries  
- [ ] Map current support workflows and escalation paths  
- [ ] Identify repetitive tasks suitable for scripting  
- [ ] Define first automation (password reset or onboarding)  
- [ ] Draft weekly ticket summary template
